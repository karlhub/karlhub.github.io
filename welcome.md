## Quotes
> I find your lack of faith disturbing. - Darth Vader

## Code examples
Inline code blocks can be wrapped in backticks: `var example = true`.

Longer block of code can be indented with four spaces:

    if (isLearning){
      return true
    }

GitHub also supports something called code fencing, which allows for multiple lines without indentation:

```
if (isLearning){
  return true
}
```

And if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```
